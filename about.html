                                <p>People with dentophobia, also called odontophobia, have a fear of dentists. Someone with dentophobia may have extreme anxiety at the thought of going to the dentist or while in the dentist’s office.</p>

                                    Dentophobia is an extreme fear that’s out of proportion to the situation. People with dentophobia avoid seeing the dentist even when they’re in pain. This condition is so severe that it can lead to very poor dental health.

                            The Dentist Themselves: This is when patients are frightened of the actual person, or the idea of the person, who will be treating them.
                            The Dental Practice: Some patients are scared of the sounds, smells, and sights they encounter at a dentist’s office. Typically, this means that they are physically put off from even entering the premises.
                            Pain: Many patients are afraid of the pain that they believe comes with visiting the dentist.
                            Needles: Patients who are scared of needles in other contexts, such as a visit to the doctor, might be afraid of them at the dentist also.
                            Gagging: In some cases, patients who are scared of choking may fear the idea of having to hold their mouth open for an extended period. They might believe that they’re going to gag or that they might struggle to breathe with something being inserted into their mouth.</p>

                        <p class="mb-3">Visit a dentist that specializes in helping patients with dental fear.
                            If you have not set an appointment with a dentist yet, it is time to get one. Your first step is to look for the best dentist on the record.
                            You may ask around or consult your friends or family members who know reputable dentists near you. Their good referral will help you build your confidence and trust to visit a dentist.
                            Divert your attention to other things while in a dentist’s chair.
                            Actually sitting on a dentist’s chair will manifest your dentophobia. Just the idea that someone will perform those you thought are scary procedures is chilling.
                            When you are seated you can make yourself busy by looking around, listening to your favorite music on your headphones, or watching TV if there is one in the dentist’s room. Keeping yourself entertained while waiting for the dentist will ease your mind.
                            Review your dentist’s way of handling procedures and treatments.
                            If you already have a dentist but are still afraid to face another session, you might want to check his procedures and how he handles different oral treatments. It will help you feel at ease or confident and could give you enough courage to call for an appointment.
                            See your psychologist first.
                            If you really can’t help and need some guidance, you can consult with your psychologist prior to your dental checkup. He or she understands your struggles better and could help you avert your fears and develop positive attitudes on how you can turn your next dental appointment into a successful visit.</p>

                            Acupuncture: A trained acupuncturist gently inserts hair-thin needles into your body at specific points to help relieve anxiety related to dental visits.
                            Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Many healthcare providers use CBT along with exposure therapy. CBT helps you change the way you see and respond to situations that trigger symptoms.
                            Distraction: Dentists may offer music, movies or TV shows to help distract your mind from your dental treatment.
                            Guided imagery: You can use relaxation, visualization and positive suggestion to create a sense of well-being. You think of the sights, sounds and smells of a place that’s pleasing to you, such as a beach or the mountains.
                            Hypnotherapy: Healthcare providers use guided relaxation techniques and focused attention to help change your perception of situations. Studies have shown that hypnotherapy has helped people cope with stressful dental treatments.
                            Relaxation techniques: Practicing deep breathing and muscle relaxation can help you lower stress and anxiety levels.
                            Sedation: Your dentist can provide sedation (medication) to help you relax during treatments. Medications may include nitrous oxide (laughing gas), pills taken orally or IV sedation (through a vein).</p></div>

                            In addition to seeking long-term treatment if needed, you can try certain techniques to cope with dentophobia during a dental visit. You might:
                            
                            Schedule a consultation with your dentist before you have a care visit. Your dentist can tell you about next steps, so you feel more comfortable moving forward.
                            Tell your dentist that you’re anxious so they can best help you. They may suggest calming medications or other techniques.
                            Bring a friend with you to offer support.
                            Choose a dentist who listens to you and works with you to help reduce your anxiety. These dentists are known as fear-free dentists.
                            Come up with a signal that tells your dentist to stop if you need a break during treatment.
                            Visit your dentist at a less busy time of day, such as early in the morning, to limit the impact of noise from other patients’ treatments.</p></div>
